                    <div class="info">
                        I have been working as a president of my high school club called Multicultural Interaction of
                        China since September of 2020. To establish a good atmosphere and relationship among club
                        members, I have organized three online electric sports events from October 2020 to April 2021.

                        The idea of organizing online events came to my mind when we had routine meetings among club
                        leaders. I found it hard to get close to most of the club members because of the pandemic.
                        Therefore, I came up with the idea to play popular phone games to have members be involved. I
                        set up a meeting among leaders to decide which game to play. Opinions differed, so I suggested
                        voting for the final decision. At the end of the session, we chose Honor of Kings, famous both
                        in China and America. For other ideas, we discussed using them for later events to diversify the
                        content of events. While preparing the event, I divided the entire work into parts, including
                        register, publicity, and execution. To avoid external assistance to make the game unfair, I
                        asked the registering member to set up a registering form including personal information to
                        check at the beginning of the game. I arranged publicity plans with poster design and posted
                        them on the club website to get more attention from club members. The art chair designed a
                        poster containing attractive game information and prize for winners. When the game started, the
                        vice president and I were in charge of controlling the entire situation. Another leader was
                        involved in recording climax moments and results to present on the club website and send to
                        members. At the end of the game, the winner was announced with a special prize. Other
                        participators got the bonus to have discounts on milk tea in which milk tea shop sponsored the
                        club.

                        With my effort to lead my leader team to organize well, this online event was unexpectedly
                        successful so that more club members would like to participate and look forward to later
                        activities.

                        I believe that I am a person with a creative side in computer science and able to solve facing
                        problems with innovative thinking. I have discovered my creation while learning Computer Science
                        both at the college course and self-improvement learning. To utilize skills and programming
                        capacities in the practical section, I started to look for opportunities in my life and campus
                        work. As I became the president of the MIC club in my high school, I found there was a lack of
                        information presentation methods to record significant events and publicize the club. Combining
                        my interest and acquirement in programming and computer science studies, I decided to create a
                        website.

                        At the beginning of the website building, I faced challenges though I have practiced a lot since
                        I started my CS learning, such as the difference between a club website from an e-commerce
                        website I have attempted to make before. I researched various designs of web pages for
                        navigation bars, layout, and submenu settings. After that, I analyzed the usages of my club
                        website, which I knew the best. Later as I have built up the primary website, I found some user
                        interfaces seemed dull without transition and special effects. So I worked to optimize the code
                        to provide multiple submenus and pages for users. Moreover, the slow loading speed of pictures
                        has been solved using my previous studies on coding and programming. Apart from improving on
                        professional coding aspects, I have asked for advice among club members to set up unique columns
                        such as specialized event register entrance and communication section to increase more
                        connection among members for a better relationship during the pandemic and long term development
                        of the club.Therefore, our club has been developed rapidly on campus with immediate updated
                        information and a friendly online environment.

                        Throughout my entire school life, I found myself with autonomous learning ability. I constantly
                        yearn to search for brand-new knowledge in areas I am interested in. I would not be satisfied
                        with fundamental points I have earned from classes or books but attempt to research deeply for
                        more.
                        The most outstanding example could be my independent studies on coding and programming. The
                        first time I got in touch with coding and programming was the C++ course in eighth grade. We
                        were taught fundamental theories about coding and the general process of building HTML websites.
                        I was strongly attracted, so that I expected more out of the class. Thus, I searched online for
                        related teaching videos and books on YouTube or Bilibili, famous in China for self-learning.
                        After half-year learning, I acquired skills such as web spider and Python crawler. I have spent
                        most of my spare time experimenting with my learning result. So I have tried to code some
                        automated tools, including automated crawl for novels, information in online shops, automated,
                        simultaneous comments typing. At that time, I worked as an organizer of an online study room on
                        Bilibili to open live music and background sound and accompany people. To encourage them, I
                        coded automated, simultaneous comments typing on the live video to encourage people to study in
                        the online live room.
                        Since I practiced the basic coding process, I expected to learn more specific aspects of
                        Computer Science. Therefore, I purchased lessons about web development. As my self-studies
                        continued, I found it a general and helpful area in Computer Science that I would like to keep
                        working on. I even used my current skills to build up an original club website for my MIC club.
                        Along with practical work, I still learned Javascript, HTML/CSS to improve the website. My
                        strong autonomous learning ability also affected my future major and career decision to study
                        Computer Science at the university and work in software engineering for my career goal.

                        The most significant challenge I have faced was taking AP Physics 1 & AP Physics 2 in junior
                        years. The previous test results were in a mess, and it was hard to understand the lesson with a
                        lack of fundamental physics background well established in former semesters. I was depressed and
                        stuck in the situation to overcome it as our physics teacher reminded us to set up an
                        appropriate goal and keep working for it. He compared the studies of physics problems to growing
                        trees, and it was crucial to aim at the root for watering, which is like figuring out individual
                        capacities and repeatedly working for it. He said that when things are easy, you redo it; when
                        things become challenging, you practice when it is easy, which strongly inspired me.
                        With the inspiration of the physics teacher, I started to brace myself up. First, I collected
                        previous test papers we did the last term to do it again daily. Furthermore, I invited one of my
                        friends to accompany me. We made a study pair to encourage each other. Every afternoon after the
                        class, we open a zoom meeting to do homework, explain problems to each other. We collected
                        mistakes we made in a file to review every day as a routine. Multiple choice and free response
                        parts were two main difficulties to overcome in the final test. With slight improvement but
                        still unsatisfied results, we constantly worked harder in the winter break. I spent three hours
                        studying Physics, redid the old tests, and searched for some multiple-choice questions online to
                        practice my weakness. Even before the AP test and second semester final, my friend and I spent
                        extra five hours a day working on specific physics problems.

                        As a result, the result for the second semester raised a grade with all AP tests passed. Thus,
                        to look back on my studies, I become firmly assured that I could be one with the accurate
                        academic aim and constantly work for it to achieve my long-term educational and career goal.

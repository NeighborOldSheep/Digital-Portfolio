                        For me the top three talents or skills are play piano, coding and cooking.
                        The greatest talent for me is coding. I learn it by myself, it's very hard when I just start
                        learning it, this skill is something that is not developed in a day. First time I was learned
                        C++ at 8th grade, at that time I don't even not what does function meaning, and I give up at
                        pointer. Half a year later I started learning Python. It's much easier than C++. At that time
                        I'm 9th grade. I used half a year to learn the syntax, and then started learning WebSpider. At
                        that time I felt like coding is really fun stuff, I wrote a script for bilibili steamer studio
                        to automatically send text, you can edit the text you want to send and it will send by the time
                        it ends. When I became a sophomore I was interested in cyber security. I learned some basic
                        knowledge about how to find a bug on a website, and I found a single XSS bug in a small website,
                        which I am very proud of myself. In August 2020 I will start a new journey for coding, which is
                        to build a website for our club. Then I learned Javascript, HTML/CSS and I did it, the website
                        is a static and publish on Google(<a
                            href="https://neighboroldsheep.github.io/AHS_MIC/index.html">https://neighboroldsheep.github.io/AHS_MIC/index.html</a>)
                        right
                        now I'm learning a Python Django framework try to build a dynamic website.

                        During the school years Physics is a subject that inspires me a lot. In the class I learned how
                        to properly study a subject, especially a subject related to Math. For example if one day is
                        like a tree, the time is water when you pour the water to the tree, you should pour to the root
                        only this way can let tree growth up, same logic with study, that tree is subject water is time,
                        only when you use spent time to study that subject, which the tree can growth up. When you study
                        you should always have a friend who can help you. Sometimes there are always difficult questions
                        to deal with, when you study with your friend that can be quickly solved, during that solving
                        process you will learn a lot. Beside the class, I also learned that time management is
                        important. One day only has 24 hours, it's really important to learn how to distribute those
                        times. You can watch TV or play video games all time, but you wouldn't learn anything from
                        watching TV and playing video games. However, if you properly distribute the time then success
                        is not far for you. For example you decide study at sunday, which before sunday the schedule
                        need to be complete what time you should do what things, if you keep doing this everyday after
                        long time those schedule will automatically generate at you mind,then only one thing you need to
                        do is take action, you have plan you have a goal then you only need to take action and achieve
                        it.

                        One thing I did to make my school better is create a Chinese Club called M.I.C(Multi-Cultural
                        Interaction of China). We know that America is an immigrant country, which means in a school
                        there should have lots of immigrant students, they might come from different countries. M.I.C
                        club gives all chinese immigrants a "home" in campancy, in the club they can make lots of new
                        friends, even some people just come to our school M.I.C club can help them as fast as possible
                        to adapt to this new environment. In M.I.C club we have lots of activities and hang out events,
                        we organize to eat some traditional chinese food, and play some chinese games to improve each
                        other's emotions. Also, our club has leadership provided to our members, that way they will have
                        some opportunity to apply to become some leader to exercise their leadership skill, try to
                        organize activity,learn how to manage a club,if I graduate they will have chance to reopen this
                        club, since they already know lots thing about this club. Beside my club I also pick up trash to
                        clean up our community. Since my Government topic is Global warming, I need to sign up for some
                        volunteer activity to pick up some trash at the beach to protect our environment . Also if I
                        have a chance I will propagate to other people rather throw trash away you should throw into the
                        trans can.

                        One thing I challenge myself is to take AP Physics 1 & AP Physics 2 in junior years.
                        It was very hard when the class just began. I didn't learn well in the first few chapters.
                        Usually I get a F or D on the test, luckily in the AP Physics class we have a curve to help us
                        don't fail the class. I start rewriting my previous test every single day until the first
                        semester final comes. Some test questions my Physics teacher makes are really difficult to
                        solve, but he tells us if you think the question is difficult, rewrite it, after rewriting
                        hundreds of thousands of times it will automatically become easier. "When things are easy you
                        redo it, when things become hard you practice when it is easy." I remember this sentence and
                        study really hard with my friend. When class ends we usually start our own zoom meeting to do
                        the homework, explain problems to each other. Finally, the first semester final is coming. There
                        are two parts of the test, free response and multiple choice. For me, the free response part is
                        kind of ok, but the multiple choice part is too hard. The whole class average is 18/35, the
                        final grade for the first semester is a C. During the winter break I feel like I should study
                        more hard, I start search problem online during winter break I spend 3 hours everyday to study
                        Physics, redo old test, search some multiple choice question to practice my weakness part.
                        FInally the AP test and second semester final will be coming. Last month I spent 5.5 hours
                        everyday with my friend to do physics problems and understand each topic. Finally, all the work
                        I did was a gift for me, my second semester, both AP Physics gardes is a B, both AP Tests I
                        passed! I was very excited, all the work I did was worth it. This is how I overcame this
                        challenge during my school.
